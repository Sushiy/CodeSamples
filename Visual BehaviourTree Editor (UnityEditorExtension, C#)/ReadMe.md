# BehaviourTree Editor

A selection of files from my Visual BehaviourTree Editor Tool.
It is complimented by a number of NodeClasses that define specific Behaviour.
The User can actually implement those Classes any way he sees fit and as long as they implement INode they will show up in the editor.
