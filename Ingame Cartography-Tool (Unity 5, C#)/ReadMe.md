#Ingame Cartography Tool

This was my bachelor's thesis. It was made as part of the larger game concept for a Exploration Survival Adventure in which the player is a cartographer.
The cartography solution uses mostly Rendertextures and a number of tricks in the setup and rendering of mapelements in order to achive better performance.
