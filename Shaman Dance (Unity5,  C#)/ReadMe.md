#Shaman Dance

This Game was made for Global Game Jam Trier 2016. Aside from the original idea and Game Design, my part was mostly Animations (As it has been in so many projects i've worked on).
In this particular Game this meant that I also worked on the main mechanic, which is basically gesture dancing with your arms in the correct rythm.
