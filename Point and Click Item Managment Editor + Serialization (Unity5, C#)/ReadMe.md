#Point and Click Itemmanagement Editor + Serialization

This is my current project. In order to later save time during content creation we decided to build a few systems/tool that we would need later on.
My task was to create an EditorExtension that would allow us to easily create and edit the manifold interactions between different objects and items in our game without using code.
The solution should also allow easily editing dialogue and interaction texts. Therefore everything is serialized into human-readable XML files.
